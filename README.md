# Incorporating Multi-Modal fushion in Text classification Using Graph Convolution Network
This project aims to enhance text classification tasks by incorporating multi-modal information using Graph Convolutional Networks. The integration of textual and visual features is achieved through a novel approach that leverages GCN to capture complex relationships within the data.
# Features
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN): This is a TensorFlow implementation of Graph Convolutional Networks for the task of (semi-supervised) classification of nodes in a graph.Utilize GCN to model relationships and dependencies within the data.
Multi-Modal Fusion:Multi-modal Graph Convolution Network is a novel multi-modal recommendation framework based on graph convolutional networks, explicitly modeling modal-specific user preferences to enhance micro-video recommendation. We update the code and use the full-ranking strategy for validation and testing. Combine textual and visual features for improved text classification.
